# Blazor Module
Everything you need to include Blazor components inside the pages, MVC views, and Template Views of your Orchard Core Module.

**NOTE: This currently only works with Themes that have Razor layouts like TheTheme. It does not work with Themes like the Blog or Agency Themes that use liquid layouts.**

## Usage
1. Add a refference to the `DrewBrasher.OrchardCore.Blazor` project to your Orchard Core Module.

2. Add `DrewBrasher.OrchardCore.Blazor` to the Dependencies of your Module's `Manifest.cs`` file.
   ```
	Dependencies = [ "DrewBrasher.OrchardCore.Blazor" ]
   ```
3. Add the tag helper to your `_ViewImports.cshtml` file:
   ```
	@addTagHelper *, DrewBrasher.OrchardCore.Blazor
   ```
4.  Add your component to a page or view like this:
	```
	<blazor-component type="typeof(DemoComponent)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
	```
	If your theme uses a Zone other than `HeadMeta` for rendering meta data, you can specify the zone like this:
	```
	<blazor-component type="typeof(DemoComponent)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" header-zone="YourHeadZoneHere" />
	```
