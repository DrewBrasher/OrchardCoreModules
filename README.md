# Orchard Core Modules

## Projects in Progress

### Content Warning Module 
#### [DrewBrasher.OrchardCore.ContentWarning](https://github.com/DrewBrasher/OrchardCoreModules/tree/0e264d5e57ac08022b8e11a284c8daf69863da3a/DrewBrasher.OrchardCore.ContentWarning)
This will be a module that allows you to add a content warning to some content in Orchard Core using the <https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/considering-content-warnings-in-html/> blog post by [Aaron Gustafson](https://github.com/aarongustafson) as a guideline. There is a discussion about the module here: <https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/discussions/13643>

I will be kicking off this project with an Ochard Core Pair Programming by Lombiq session that will be live streamed here:
